## 1. Project Overview
The Intelligent Book Management System is a cloud-based application that leverages AI to provide an enhanced book management experience. The system allows users to manage books, generate AI-powered summaries, give ratings and reviews, summarize reviews, and receive personalized recommendations while maintaining a secure and scalable architecture.

## 2. Business Requirements
- Create a modular, scalable and maintainable book management system
- System Should be able to help users to add, update retrive books from db.
- Generate Summaries, recommend books based on user preferrences, manage and generate user review summary via open source AI model.
- Ensure secure access to the system via basic Auth
- Support cloud deployment for global accessibility
- Should be accessible via restfull API calls
